**A10 - Smalltalk**

<!--

General
========

For each of your team's implementations, explain the following (where appropriate and applicable):

- details on calling conventions, input and output data formats, limitations, bugs, and special features.
- negative aspects of your program (limitations, known bugs)
- positive aspects (extensions, special features)
- describe your choice of modularization (abstractions), data structures, and algorithms
- explain anything you did that is likely to be different from what other students may have done
- justify any design decisions for which the rationale isn't immediately clear

Feel free to modify the structure of this `readme.html` file to fit the current assignment and to fit how you wish to present your findings.

Implementation
================

Many of the methods are quite similar in that they follow the same pattern of: provide basecase, check node (for some), check left tree, check right tree.
In fact, pretty much every single predicate can be broken down into those steps, some having a few additional operations but often nothing
extremely complex. Once I understood the recursion of everything better, the methods were really rather easy to code. Admittedly, having done prolog
before from assignment 1 made this all much easier since I was already relatively familiar with the syntax. I like the style of prolog programming,
especially for programs that lend themselves well to recursion. I imagine, however, that more complex and larger programs would be extremely tedious in this language outside
of simple/basic structures and mathematics. For instance, designing a website in Prolog seems like it would take forever and be very inefficient.

inorder
--------------------------------
,,,
% inorder/2
% inorder - returns a boolean of if In is an inorder traversal of a tree Tree
inorder(void, []). % basecase
inorder(tree(X, L, R), In) :-
    inorder(L, Ls), % left tree traversal
    inorder(R, Rs), % right tree traversal
    append(Ls, [X|Rs], In). % combined traversal with root node.
,,,


subtree/2
--------------------------------
,,,
% subtree/2
% subtree - returns true of Subtree is a subtree of Tree
subtree(Tree, Tree). % basecase
subtree(tree(_, L, _), Subtree) :-
    subtree(L, Subtree). % check left subtree
subtree(tree(_, _, R), Subtree) :-
    subtree(R, Subtree). % check right subtree
,,,

sumtree/2
--------------------------------
,,,
% sumtree/2
% sumtree - for an integer tree get the sum of all nodes
sumtree(void, 0). % basecase
% we traverse the tree and add each node to our sum
sumtree(tree(X, Left, Right), Sum) :-
    sumtree(Left, LeftSum),
    sumtree(Right, RightSum),
    Sum is X + LeftSum + RightSum. % calculate sum
,,,

ordered/1
--------------------------------
The longest and most difficult function to write because it required multiple helpers.
,,,
% ordered/1
% bigger helper
bigger(_, void). % basecase
bigger(X, tree(Y, Left, Right)) :-
    X > Y,
    bigger(X, Left),
    bigger(X, Right).

% smaller helper
smaller(_, void). % basecase
smaller(X, tree(Y, Left, Right)) :-
    X < Y, % X must be smaller than the root Y
    smaller(X, Left),
    smaller(X, Right).

% ordered - returns true if tree is a BST with NO duplicates
ordered(void). % basecase
ordered(tree(X, Left, Right)) :-
    smaller(X, Left),
    bigger(X, Right),
    ordered(Left),
    ordered(Right). % must meet all 4 conditions.
,,,

pathto/3
--------------------------------
,,,
% pathto/3
% return true if [path] is a path to a key
pathto(void, _, []) :- !, fail. % basecase

pathto(tree(Key, _, _), Key, []). % key is root

pathto(tree(_, Left, _), Key, [left|Path]) :-
    pathto(Left, Key, Path). % key is in left subtree

pathto(tree(_, _, Right), Key, [right|Path]) :-
    pathto(Right, Key, Path). % key is in right subtree
,,,

substitute/4
--------------------------------
% substitute/4
% - substitute is true when TreeY is the result of replacing all X in TreeX with Y
substitute(void, _, void, _). % basecase

% X is the root of TreeX
substitute(tree(X, Lx, Rx), X, tree(Y, Ly, Ry), Y) :-
    substitute(Lx, X, Ly, Y), % Recursively substitute in the left subtree
    substitute(Rx, X, Ry, Y). % Recursively substitute in the right subtree

% X is NOT the root of TreeX
substitute(tree(Z, Lx, Rx), X, tree(Z, Ly, Ry), Y) :-
    Z \= X,
    substitute(Lx, X, Ly, Y), % Recursively substitute in the left subtree
    substitute(Rx, X, Ry, Y). % Recursively substitute in the right subtree

Extra Credit
binsearch/2
--------------------------------
,,,
% binsearch/2
% perform binary search for a key in a tree
binsearch(void, _) :- !, fail. % basecase

binsearch(tree(Key, _, _), Key) :- 
    write(Key),
    !. % key is at root

binsearch(tree(Root, Left, _), Key) :- 
    Key < Root,
    write(Root),
    binsearch(Left, Key). % key in lstree

binsearch(tree(Root, _, Right), Key) :- 
    Key > Root,
    write(Root),
    binsearch(Right, Key). % key in rstree
,,,

trees
----------------------------------
,,,
tree1(T) :- T = tree(7, void, void).

tree2(T) :- T = tree(8, tree(4, tree(2, void, void), tree(6, void, void)), tree(12, tree(10, void, void), tree(14, void, void))).

tree3(T) :- T = tree(10, tree(5, tree(5, void, void), void), tree(15, tree(15, void, void), void)).

tree4(T) :- T = tree(7, tree(1, void, void), tree(5, void, void)).

tree33(T) :- T = tree(10, tree(5, tree(5, void, void), void), tree(155, tree(155, void, void), void)).

Assignment Reflection
======================
I enjoy prolog but find it very tedious at times. Especially with having to 'define' things multiple times in a sense the language easily becomes
confusing and difficult to read. With that, I will admit that if I was experienced in it I bet I'd find it rather easy, especially for tasks like this.
All these functions would likely require much more code if written in a language like Java or Python so prolog does allow a bit more simplicity.
